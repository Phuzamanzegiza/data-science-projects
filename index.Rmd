## Welcome

Welcome to my project! This is the main page of the site.

## About

This repository contains a collection of my data science projects that demonstrate my ability to handle large datasets, apply machine learning algorithms, and derive insights from data. These projects cover a broad spectrum of applications, particularly focusing on consumer analytics and big data.
